📊 Telecom Plan Revenue Analysis – Surf vs Ultimate

This project analyzes customer behavior and revenue patterns for the telecom operator Megaline, which offers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate.
Using real customer usage data—including calls, texts, and internet consumption—we evaluate which plan brings in more monthly revenue and why.

The goal of this analysis is to support Megaline’s commercial department in making data-driven decisions about advertising, budgeting, and pricing strategies.

🔍 Key Objectives

Compare the average monthly revenue of the Surf and Ultimate plans.

Identify usage patterns (calls, texts, internet) that impact total revenue.

Perform statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether revenue differences between the plans are significant.

Provide insights and recommendations for marketing and plan optimization.

📈 Methods Used

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization of customer behavior

Statistical Hypothesis Testing (two-sample t-test)

Revenue modeling based on usage beyond package limits

🧠 Key Findings

Although the Ultimate plan is priced higher, Surf plan users often exceed usage limits, especially for internet data.

As a result, Surf users generate significant extra revenue—often more than Ultimate plan users.

On average, Surf users pay $57/month, while the Ultimate plan costs $70/month, but most Ultimate users do not exceed included limits.

Statistical testing shows no significant difference in average revenue between the two groups, despite usage differences.

The company could benefit from promoting the Ultimate plan, or adjusting Surf’s overage pricing structure.

📌 Conclusion

Both plans generate comparable revenue, but Surf’s overage charges are the main driver of extra profit.
To optimize revenue, Megaline should consider:

Promoting the Ultimate plan (especially to heavy internet users)

Revising Surf plan limits to balance transparency and profitability

Using customer segmentation for targeted marketing
